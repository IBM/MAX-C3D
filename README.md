# IBM Code Model Asset Exchange: Sports Video Classifier

This repository contains code to instantiate and deploy a video classification model. The model recognizes the 487 different classes of sports activities in the [Sports-1M Dataset](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepvideo/). The model consists of a deep 3-D convolutional net that was trained on the Sports-1M dataset. The input to the model is a video, and the output is a list of estimated class probabilities.

The model is based on the [C3D TensorFlow Model](https://github.com/hx173149/C3D-tensorflow). The model files are hosted on [IBM Cloud Object Storage](http://max-assets.s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/tf/c3d/max_c3d_sports1m_tf.tar.gz). The code in this repository deploys the model as a web service in a Docker container. This repository was developed as part of the [IBM Code Model Asset Exchange](https://developer.ibm.com/code/exchanges/models/).

## Pre-requisites:

* `docker`: The [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) command-line interface. Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for your system.
* The minimum recommended resources for this model is 2GB Memory and 2 CPUs.

## Steps

1. [Build the Model](#1-build-the-model)
2. [Deploy the Model](#2-deploy-the-model)
3. [Use the Model](#3-use-the-model)
4. [Development](#4-development)
5. [Clean Up](#5-clean-up)

## 1. Build the Model

Clone this repository locally. In a terminal, run the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Sports-Video-Classifier.git
```

Change directory into the repository base folder:

```
$ cd MAX-Sports-Video-Classifier
```

To build the docker image locally, run: 

```
$ docker build -t max-sports-video-classifier .
```

All required model assets will be downloaded during the build process. _Note_ that currently this docker image is CPU only (we will add support for GPU images later).

## 2. Deploy the Model

To run the docker image, which automatically starts the model serving API, run:

```
$ docker run -it -p 5000:5000 max-sports-video-classifier
```

## 3. Use the Model

The API server automatically generates an interactive Swagger documentation page. Go to `http://localhost:5000` to load it. From there you can explore the API and also create test requests.

Use the `model/predict` endpoint to load a test video file and get predicted labels for the video from the API.

You can also test it on the command line, for example:

```
$ curl -F "video=@assets/basketball.mp4" -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:5000/model/predict
```

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "predictions": [
    {
      "label_id": "367",
      "label": "basketball",
      "probability": 0.39916181564331
    },
    {
      "label_id": "370",
      "label": "streetball",
      "probability": 0.16513635218143
    },
    {
      "label_id": "369",
      "label": "3x3 (basketball)",
      "probability": 0.11865037679672
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Development

To run the Flask API app in debug mode, edit `config.py` to set `DEBUG = True` under the application settings. You will then need to rebuild the docker image (see [step 1](#1-build-the-model)).

## 5. Cleanup

To stop the Docker container, type `CTRL` + `C` in your terminal.
